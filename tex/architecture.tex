\subsection{Architecture}

\slnkcctr{} prototype consists of three main components:

\begin{itemize}
\item slinky end detector,
\item beat detector and
\item sound player.
\end{itemize}

The operation of the components is synchronized with the camera frames.

In each frame and for each of the two ends of the slinky,
a \emph{slinky end detector} tries to detect and localize
the slinky end in the image.

The presence indication and coordinates are then passed to
a \emph{beat detector} which uses this information
and previous values to determine whether
a beat occurred in the current frame.

In case a beat has occurred, \emph{sound player} is asked
to play back a sound corresponding to the slinky end.

% TODO: Optional: Make a picture of components.
